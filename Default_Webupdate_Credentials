=============================
cat /mnt/persistent/trace_log/log/swUpgrade/swUpgrade.log | grep "Author"
2020/03/09 12:45:13  swuSystem.c:548  pid=47873  libcurl: 003c: Authorization: Basic c2VuX3I6JFNlbkBSMg==

opgezocht en HTTP basic authorization is base64, met format: user:password

Decoding via: echo c2VuX3I6JFNlbkBSMg== | base64 -d
gives: sen_r:$Sen@R2
Note: you can only download directly known tar URLs with this password, you can't browse the directory for searching files..

***
we could probably use tcpdump for this aswell (root privileges required)
tcpdump -i any -w - | strings | grep -i "Authorization: Basic"
***

//CAREFUL..
When using a custom webupdate url like the BKM url, the user credentials will also be visible... :-)

TODO - method isn't allowed anymore.. I guess they uses SSL all the time now.
